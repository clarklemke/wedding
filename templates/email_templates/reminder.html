    A few folks have asked:
</p>
<b>Kids at Wedding //</b>
While we love all of the children in our lives, we are choosing to keep our wedding and reception an adults-only
event so you can enjoy a fun night with us! Thank you for your understanding.
<p>
    <b>Gifts for Wedding //</b>
    We would prefer our guests don't bring gifts. We are grateful that you're choosing to spend the day with us!
</p>
</p>
<p>
    - Anna and Clark
