                <p>Vancouver is located on the beautiful Pacific Coast of Canada, where the mountains meet the sea.Â </p>
                <p>
                    For those traveling into Vancouver, we recommend arriving via either Vancouver International Airport
                    (YVR) or Abbotsford International Airport (YXX).
                    YVR is connected directly to Vancouver city center via rapid transit on the Skytrain.

                <p>
                    Below is a brief list of recommendations on places to stay in Vancouver.
                </p>
                <table class="table">
                    <tr>

                                Vancouver Metrotown</a>
                            is located located about 10 minute drive from the venue.
                            We have a block of discounted rooms reserved there - use the code <code>CODE TO COME</code>
                            to get the group discount.

                        <th>Inn at the Quay</th>
                        <td>
                            The Inn at the Quay is located in New Westminster - the area that Clark grew up in.
                            We were unable to get a group rate so just make a normal booking through
                            <a href="https://www.innatwestminsterquay.com/">their website</a>.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Vacation rentals</th>
                        <td>
                            Both <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/">VRBO</a> and <a
                                href="https://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> have a number of vacation rentals in the area.
                            This is also a highly recommended and often more affordable option for those who don't mind
                            something a bit more self-service.
