                                Garden Inn</a> is conveniently located just off the highway and very close to the
                            wedding venue.
                            It is about a 20 minute drive to downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                            We have a block of discounted rooms reserved there - use the code <code>LZW16</code> to get
                            the group discount.

                            The White Oaks is very close to - and similar to - the Hilton Garden Inn.
                            We were unable to get a group rate so just make a normal booking through <a

                            Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                            We recommend just jumping on <a

                            This is also a highly recommended and often more affordable option for those who don't mind
                            something a bit more self-service.
